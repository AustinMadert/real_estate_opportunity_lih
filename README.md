# Identifying Real Estate Opportunity for Low Income Housing Programs

A 5 minute video presentation is available <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ozYt1Slhf8'>here</a>

Austin population growth and housing market are affecting homeless populations in the city. This project addresses low
income housing program planning using clustering to rank properties within the city of Austin based on how useful they 
would be to a potential housing program. The project uses three main factors to assess prime properties:
 - Price per sqft
 - Distance to public transportation
 - Relative dispersion across the city

 The workflow is split across multiple working jupyter notebooks located in the 'notebooks' folder. Additionally, scrapers and 
 helper functions can be found in the src and helper_functions folders respectively.
